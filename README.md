# To Completely Block Facebook
# Add these entries below to your hosts file
#
# Your hosts file Location:
# Linux, Unix and Mac OS X  -> /etc/hosts
# Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 ->  C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
# Windows 2000  -> C:\WINNT\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
# Windows 98/ME ->  C:\WINDOWS\hosts 
# 
# You can edit the hosts file with any text editor
#
# On Windows 7, the default AV security scan will try to remove the
# facebook.com entry; you'll need to add an exception to tell the OS
# to keep the block listing in the hosts file and not to remove it
